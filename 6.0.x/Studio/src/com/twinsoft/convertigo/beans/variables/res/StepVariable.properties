display_name=Call single-valued variable
short_description=Defines a single-valued variable for a step. | A {{Reference}}Call single-valued variable{{-Reference}} is used to send a single-valued {{Computer}}input{{-Computer}} variable to a transaction (or sequence) targeted by a {{Reference}}Call Transaction{{-Reference}} (or {{Reference}}Call Sequence{{-Reference}}) step. \n\
It can define a default value, that is used as parameter value if no value is found for this variable. This default value is specified in the {{Produit/Fonction}}Default value{{-Produit/Fonction}} property. \n\
At runtime, the variable value is calculated by Convertigo through the following steps: \
***if the {{Produit/Fonction}}Source{{-Produit/Fonction}} property is set, the variable value is a source result from a previous step of the sequence, \
***if no source is set, the JavaScript value of the variable is chosen, if a variable of the same name exists in the JavaScript scope of current context, \
***if no JavaScript variable is defined, the context value of the variable is chosen, if a variable of the same name exists in current context, \
***if none of the previous methods gives a value, the default value set in the {{Produit/Fonction}}Default value{{-Produit/Fonction}} property is used, \
***if no default value is specified, the variable is not sent to the target transaction (or sequence).
property.sourceDefinition.display_name=Source
property.sourceDefinition.short_description=Defines the source to use as variable value. | This property allows defining the variable value as a source from a previous step. \n\
A {{Reference}}source{{-Reference}} is defined as a reference on a step previously existing in the parent sequence, associated with an XPath applied on the step's result DOM. \n\
At runtime, the Xpath is applied on the step's current execution result XML and the variable takes for value the XML node value resulting from this execution. If the XPath doesn't match or if the source is left blank, the variable value is calculated as explained in the main description of this object.
