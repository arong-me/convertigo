display_name=IfIsIn
short_description=Defines an {{Computer}}IF{{-Computer}} conditional step looking for matches on a source. | The {{Reference}}IfIsIn{{-Reference}} step is one of Convertigo Sequencer conditional steps. This step is based on a source and one or more regular expression(s) called "Tests". Child steps are executed only if the specified source exists and if tests match on that specified source.
property.testDefinition.display_name=Tests
property.testDefinition.short_description=Defines match tests as regular expressions. | This property allows to define a list of tests that are applied on the source result. \n\
For each test, two elements have to be set:\
***{{Produit/Fonction}}Operator{{-Produit/Fonction}}: value to choose between {{Computer}}AND{{-Computer}} and {{Computer}}NOT{{-Computer}}, the operator value is applied on the regular expression result to keep it ({{Computer}}AND{{-Computer}}) or to inverse it ({{Computer}}NOT{{-Computer}}). \
***{{Produit/Fonction}}Regular exp{{-Produit/Fonction}}: defines a regular expression to apply (inverted or not thanks to operator value) on the source result. \n\
In order to be able to test the regular expressions on the source result, source has to select a text node. \n\
Notes:\
***For more information about regular expression patterns, see the following page: {{Computer}}http://www.regular-expressions.info/reference.html{{-Computer}}. \
