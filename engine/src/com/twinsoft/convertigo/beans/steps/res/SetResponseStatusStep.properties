display_name=Set response status
short_description=Sets a response status for the current sequence. | The <i>Set response status</i> step allows set an HTTP status on the sequence's response. <br/>\
The status code and message are set using the <b>Status code</b> and the <b>Status text</b> properties. \
<br/><span class=\"orangetwinsoft\">Note:</span> Although its <b>Output</b> property is set to <span class="computer">false</span> by default, this step generates an <span class="computer">status</span> XML Element in output, that contain the status code and text in child elements.\ 
property.statusCode.display_name=Status code
property.statusCode.short_description=Defines the code value associated with the status. | This property is a "smart type" property, that allows to define the HTTP status code to set on the response. <br/>\
A "smart type" property can be of one of the following types: \
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 a <b>text</b>: the value is therefore a default text value, <br/>\
 \u2022 a <b>JavaScript expression</b>: the value is therefore a JavaScript expression that is evaluated at sequence execution, <br/>\
 \u2022 a <b>source</b>: the value is a source and can be picked using the source picker. A <b>source</b> is defined as a reference on a step previously existing in the parent sequence, associated with an XPath applied on the step's result DOM. At runtime, the XPath is applied on the step's current execution result XML and extracts a list of XML nodes resulting from this execution. <br/>\
<br/>\
