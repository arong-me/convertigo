display_name=Fields for VT emulators
short_description=Finds and marks blocks as being of <span class="computer">field</span> type. | The <i>Fields for VT emulators</i> extraction rule applies to VT220 integration only. It is used to recognize fields in VT emulator. <br/>\
In fact, unlike in IBM mainframes, VT screens including fields are not typed as fields. Field detection is based on display attributes (background color, foreground color, etc.). When matching blocks are found, they are added to the XML document as <span class="computer">field</span> type XML elements.<br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Note:</span>XML elements of the <span class="computer">field</span> type are handled by the <span class="computer">field</span> XSL template described in the <span class="computer">field.xsl</span> file. To change the way fields are displayed in the HTML page, edit this file.
