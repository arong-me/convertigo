display_name=Get attachment
short_description=Downloads an attachment. | This statement instructs Convertigo to wait for an attachment to be fully downloaded. Even though this statement does not use any specific parameter, it requires the Convertigo internal browser to be set so as to receive attachments, by using an appropriate {{Reference}}Browser property change{{-Reference}} statement. \n\
The required property must be changed prior to executing the action that triggers the download (click on a download link for example). The property change can be included either in a previous transaction or in a handler executed prior to the download. \n\
{{Produit/Fonction}}Important note{{-Produit/Fonction}}: {{Reference}}Get attachment{{-Reference}} statement must be executed immediately after the action that triggers the download.\n\
Once the download is complete, the final destination for the retrieved document depends on the context:\
***If the transaction was executed in the Convertigo studio, the document is stored in a temporary file.\
***If the transaction was executed on the Convertigo server, depending on the value of the {{Produit/Fonction}}File path{{-Produit/Fonction}} property, the document is retrieved locally on the server if the {{Produit/Fonction}}File path{{-Produit/Fonction}} property is positioned, or sent back to the requester as binary data with the correct MIME type otherwise. 
property.timeout.display_name=Timeout
property.timeout.short_description=Defines the download timeout in millisecond. | This property allows to define the maximum time to wait for the file to be downloaded. If the file download is not finished at the end of this time, the download is aborted. 
property.policy.display_name=Attachment recovery policy
property.policy.short_description=Defines the policy for recovering the attachment. | If a file with the same name has already been downloaded, this property can take one of the following values:\
***{{Computer}}localfile_increment{{-Computer}}: increments the name of the file with a number in order not to lose previous version, \
***{{Computer}}localfile_override{{-Computer}}: overrides the previously downloaded file with the new version, \
***{{Computer}}base64{{-Computer}}: encodes in base 64 the downloaded file.\n\
If this property is left empty, the {{Computer}}localfile_increment{{-Computer}} policy is applied.
property.filename.display_name=File path
property.filename.short_description=JavaScript expression defining the file path, including the file name, of the file to get (optional). | If set, this property allows to override the initial file name and to define the path to the directory where the file must be get. The path is either absolute or relative to the project's directory. Paths starting with:\
***{{Computer}}./{{-Computer}} are relative to Convertigo home,\
***{{Computer}}.//{{-Computer}} are relative to the project folder.
property.threshold.display_name=Threshold
property.threshold.short_description=Defines the downloading activity threshold in millisecond. | The {{Reference}}HTML connector{{-Reference}} can not know when a file download is terminated. On the other side, the {{Reference}}HTML connector{{-Reference}} knows about downloading activity. \n\
This property allows to define a maximum time of inactivity to wait after the last downloading activity. If this threshold time is reached, the file download is considered as finished.
