display_name=Get attachment
short_description=Downloads an attachment. | This statement instructs Convertigo to wait for an attachment to be fully downloaded.

The required property must be changed prior to executing the action triggering the download (click on a download link for example). The property change can be included either in a previous transaction or in a handler executed prior to the download. \n\
