display_name=Screen class entry handler
short_description=Defines a screen class entry handler. | A <i>Handler</i> is similar to a <span class="computer">Function</span> except that it is automatically executed when the associated event occurs. The <i>Screen class entry handler</i> is a handler associated with the entry on a screen class event. It is executed when Convertigo detects the screen class corresponding to this <i>Screen class entry handler</i>, before executing the extraction rules associated with this screen class.<br/>\
In other words, a <i>Screen class entry handler</i> is executed when arriving on the screen class associated with this handler.<br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Notes:</span> \
<ul><li>A <i>Screen class entry handler</i> contains other statements that define the actions to be performed on this screen class. It can return a result value (<span class="computer">redetect</span> by default as it is an entry handler).</li>\
<li><i>Screen class entry handlers</i> can only be added to a transaction, one <i>Screen class entry handler</i> for each screen class per transaction.</li></ul>
property.handlerResult.display_name=Result
property.handlerResult.short_description=Defines the handler's default resulting value. | Depending on the handler type, this property can be chosen among several available values.<br/>\
For a <i>Screen class entry handler</i>, this property can take the following values:\
<ul><li><span class="computer"><empty></span> or <span class="computer">""</span>: goes on and extracts data using extraction rules, </li>\
<li><span class="computer">continue</span>: similar to <span class="computer"><empty></span> value, </li>\
<li><span class="computer">redetect</span>: does not extract data and redetects a new screen class, </li>\
<li><span class="computer">skip</span>: stops the transaction without extracting data.</li></ul><br/>\
