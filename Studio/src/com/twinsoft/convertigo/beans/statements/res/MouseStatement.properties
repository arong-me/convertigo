display_name=Mouse action
short_description=Creates a mouse action on an element of the web page. | This statement allows to trigger mouse events, provided that attributes of the accessed DOM element manage such events. <br/>\
For example, for a click on a target HTML object, this object can be a link (<span class="computer">A</span> HTML element) or a button (<span class="computer">INPUT type="button"</span> element) or any HTML object the user can click on in the web page.<br/>\
Supported mouse events, defined in the <b>Action</b> property, are the following:\
<ul><li><span class="computer">click</span>: simulates a mouse <span class="computer">click</span> event, </li>\
<li><span class="computer">mousedown</span>: simulates a <span class="computer">mousedown</span> event (first part of a mouse click event, when mouse button is clicked), </li>\
<li><span class="computer">mouseup</span>: simulates a <span class="computer">mouseup</span> event (second part of a mouse click event, when mouse button is released), </li>\
<li><span class="computer">mouseover</span>: simulates a <span class="computer">mouseover</span> event (mouse is moved onto an element), </li>\
<li><span class="computer">mouseout</span>: simulates a <span class="computer">mouseout</span> event (mouse is moved out of an element), </li>\
<li><span class="computer">mousemove</span>: simulates a <span class="computer">mousemove</span> event (mouse is moved anywhere), </li>\
<li><span class="computer">mousedrag</span>: simulates a <span class="computer">mousedrag</span> event (mouse drags an object), </li>\
<li><span class="computer">dblclick</span>: simulates a <span class="computer">dblclick</span> event (mouse double-clicks an object), </li>\
<li><span class="computer">dragdrop</span>: simulates a <span class="computer">dragdrop</span> event (mouse drags and drops an object). </li></ul><br/>\
The XPath defined in <b>XPath</b> property is applied on the web page to retrieve the element on which the event has to be performed. <br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Note:</span> For more complex actions, prefer to use the <i>Mouse action advanced</i> statement.
