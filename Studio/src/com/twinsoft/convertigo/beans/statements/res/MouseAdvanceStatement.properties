display_name=Mouse action advance
short_description=Creates a complex mouse action on an element or a position of the web page. | This statement allows to trigger complex mouse events, provided that attributes of the accessed DOM element manage such events. \n\
Supported mouse events, defined in the {{Produit/Fonction}}Action{{-Produit/Fonction}} property, are the following:\
***{{Computer}}click{{-Computer}}: simulates a {{Computer}}click{{-Computer}} event, \
***{{Computer}}mousedown{{-Computer}}: simulates a {{Computer}}mousedown{{-Computer}} mouse event (mouse button is depressed), \
***{{Computer}}mouseup{{-Computer}}: simulates a {{Computer}}mouseup{{-Computer}} mouse event (mouse button is released), \
***{{Computer}}mouseover{{-Computer}}: simulates a {{Computer}}mouseover{{-Computer}} mouse event (mouse is moved onto an element), \
***{{Computer}}mouseout{{-Computer}}: simulates a {{Computer}}mouseout{{-Computer}} mouse event (mouse is moved out of an element), \
***{{Computer}}mousemove{{-Computer}}: simulates a {{Computer}}mousemove{{-Computer}} mouse event (mouse is moved anywhere), \
***{{Computer}}mousedrag{{-Computer}}: simulates a {{Computer}}mousedrag{{-Computer}} mouse event (mouse drags an object), \
***{{Computer}}dblclick{{-Computer}}: simulates a {{Computer}}dblclick{{-Computer}} mouse event (mouse double-clicks an object), \
***{{Computer}}dragdrop{{-Computer}}: simulates a {{Computer}}dragdrop{{-Computer}} mouse event (mouse drags and drops an object).\n\
The element on which the event has to be performed in the web page is retrieved by the execution of the XPath defined in {{Produit/Fonction}}XPath{{-Produit/Fonction}} property. If the {{Produit/Fonction}}XPath{{-Produit/Fonction}} property is empty, the mouse position can be used to find an element on which the event should be performed. \n\
The mouse position can be defined using the {{Produit/Fonction}}Client X{{-Produit/Fonction}} and the {{Produit/Fonction}}Client Y{{-Produit/Fonction}} properties or the {{Produit/Fonction}}Screen X{{-Produit/Fonction}} and the {{Produit/Fonction}}Screen Y{{-Produit/Fonction}} properties. \n\
{{Orange Twinsoft}}Note:{{-Orange Twinsoft}} For simple actions, prefer to use the {{Reference}}Mouse action{{-Reference}} statement.
property.clientx.display_name=Client X
property.clientx.short_description=Defines the client (web browser) relative {{Computer}}X{{-Computer}} coordinate (in pixels). | This property is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the transaction execution and gives the horizontal coordinate, relatively to the top left corner of the DOM layout, at which the event should occur.
property.clienty.display_name=Client Y
property.clienty.short_description=Defines the client (web browser) relative {{Computer}}Y{{-Computer}} coordinate (in pixels). | This property is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the transaction execution and gives the vertical coordinate, relatively to the top left corner of the DOM layout, at which the event should occur.
property.screenx.display_name=Screen X
property.screenx.short_description=Defines the absolute screen {{Computer}}X{{-Computer}} coordinate (in pixels). | This property is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the transaction execution and gives the horizontal coordinate, relatively to the top left corner of the screen, at which the event should occur.
property.screeny.display_name=Screen Y
property.screeny.short_description=Defines the absolute screen {{Computer}}Y{{-Computer}} coordinate (in pixels). | This property is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the transaction execution and gives the vertical coordinate, relatively to the top left corner of the screen, at which the event should occur.
property.altkey.display_name=Press alt key
property.altkey.short_description=Defines whether the "{{Computer}}alt{{-Computer}}" key is to be depressed when firing the event. | This property is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the transaction execution as a boolean defining if the {{Computer}}alt{{-Computer}} key should be depressed when firing the event. \n\
On some platforms, the {{Computer}}alt{{-Computer}} key may map to an alternative key name.
property.button.display_name=Button
property.button.short_description=Defines which mouse button is used during the mouse event. | Some mouse events are triggered by the depression or release of a mouse button. This property is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the transaction execution and indicates which mouse button is used during this state change.\n\
This property can take the following values: \
***{{Computer}}zero{{-Computer}}: left button,\
***{{Computer}}one{{-Computer}}: middle button, if applicable,\
***{{Computer}}two{{-Computer}}: right button.\n\
For mice configured for left-handed use, in which button actions are reversed, values are reversed too (from right to left).
property.ctrlkey.display_name=Press ctrl key
property.ctrlkey.short_description=Defines whether the "{{Computer}}ctrl{{-Computer}}" key is to be depressed when firing the event. | This property is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the transaction execution as a boolean defining if the {{Computer}}ctrl{{-Computer}} key should be depressed when firing the event. \n\
On some platforms, the {{Computer}}ctrl{{-Computer}} key may map to an alternative key name.
property.metkey.display_name=Press meta key
property.metkey.short_description=Defines whether the "{{Computer}}meta{{-Computer}}" key is to be depressed when firing the event. | This property is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the transaction execution as a boolean defining if the {{Computer}}meta{{-Computer}} key should be depressed when firing the event. \n\
On some platforms, the {{Computer}}meta{{-Computer}} key may map to an alternative key name.
property.shiftkey.display_name=Press shift key
property.shiftkey.short_description=Defines whether the "{{Computer}}shift{{-Computer}}" key is to be depressed when firing the event. | This property is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the transaction execution as a boolean defining if the {{Computer}}shift{{-Computer}} key should be depressed when firing the event. \n\
On some platforms, the {{Computer}}shift{{-Computer}} key may map to an alternative key name.
