display_name=Continue with Site Clipper
short_description=Redirects to a <i>Site Clipper connector</i>. | <i>Continue with Site Clipper</i> statement ends an <i>HTML transaction</i> by redirecting the context to a <i>Site Clipper connector</i>. It is set at the end of an handler to end the <i>HTML transaction</i>, which results in that no other handler nor statement from the transaction is executed after it. <br/>\
This statement specifies a redirection URL to its parent connector in the transaction's XML output. This rewritten URL is an absolute URL pointing to the current Convertigo project, with a particular syntax:\
<ul><li>it starts with the usual project's path, </li>\
<li>it then specifies the Convertigo context and the <i>Site Clipper connector</i> to use, </li>\
<li>it ends with the <span class="computer">.siteclipper</span> extension, </li>\
<li>after the extension, the target resource URL is concatenated, replacing the '<span class="computer">://</span>' symbols after the target resource protocol, (<span class="computer">http://</span> for example, by a '<span class="computer">/</span>' character. </li></ul><br/>\
This gives the following URL form: <br/>\
<span class="computer">http://<convertigo_server_host>:<convertigo_server_port>/convertigo/projects/<project_name>/context=<context_name>&connector=<connector_name>.siteclipper/<target_resource_protocol>/<target_resource_host>/<target_resource_URI></span> <br/>\
The <i>Site Clipper connector</i> accessed thanks to this URL then relays all HTTP messages between the client and the target server. For more information about Site Clipper, see <i>Site Clipper connector</i> and related objects documentation. <br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Note:</span> The <i>Site Clipper connector</i> to which redirect is in the same project. Thus, the <i>HTML transaction</i> and the <i>Site Clipper connector</i> can share the same context.

property.siteClipperConnectorName.short_description=Define the <i>Site Clipper connector</i> to which redirect. | The target connector can be chosen among the connectors from the same project as the <i>Continue with Site Clipper</i> statement. Indeed, the HTML transaction including the <i>Continue with Site Clipper</i> statement and the <i>Site Clipper</i> connector must share the same context.
