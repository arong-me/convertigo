display_name=Default entry handler
short_description=Defines a transaction default entry handler. | A {{Reference}}Handler{{-Reference}} is similar to a {{Computer}}Function{{-Computer}} except that it is automatically executed when the associated event occurs. The {{Reference}}Default entry handler{{-Reference}} is a screen class entry handler, associated with an entry on a screen class event. If present in a transaction, it is executed when no specific screen class entry handler is defined for the currently detected screen class. In other words, it is a generic screen class entry handler.\n\
Thus, {{Reference}}Default entry handler{{-Reference}} can be defined for multiple screen classes on which the programmer knows that the same actions are to be done.\n\
Beware that this handler will be executed for the {{Computer}}Default_screen_class{{-Computer}} screen class if no specific handler is defined for this screen class. As the {{Computer}}Default_screen_class{{-Computer}} screen class matches every page that is not defined in the connector, this handler can potentially be executed on a lot of unmanaged pages. Such behaviors can lead to infinite loop transactions.\n\
{{Orange Twinsoft}}Notes:{{-Orange Twinsoft}} \
***A {{Reference}}Default entry handler{{-Reference}} contains other statements that define the actions to be performed. It can return a result value ({{Computer}}redetect{{-Computer}} by default as this is an entry handler).\
***{{Reference}}Default entry handlers{{-Reference}} can only be added to a transaction, one {{Reference}}Default entry handler{{-Reference}} per transaction.
property.handlerResult.display_name=Result
property.handlerResult.short_description=Defines the handler's default resulting value. | Depending on the handler type, this property can be chosen among several available values.\n\
For a {{Reference}}Default entry handler{{-Reference}}, this property can take the following values:\
***{{Computer}}<empty>{{-Computer}} or {{Computer}}""{{-Computer}}: goes on and extracts data using extraction rules, \
***{{Computer}}continue{{-Computer}}: similar to {{Computer}}<empty>{{-Computer}} value, \
***{{Computer}}redetect{{-Computer}}: does not extract data and redetects a new screen class, \
***{{Computer}}skip{{-Computer}}: stops the transaction without extracting data.\n\
{{Orange Twinsoft}}Note:{{-Orange Twinsoft}} The {{Reference}}Handler{{-Reference}}'s default return value defined thanks to this property can be overridden by a child {{Reference}}Return{{-Reference}} statement.
