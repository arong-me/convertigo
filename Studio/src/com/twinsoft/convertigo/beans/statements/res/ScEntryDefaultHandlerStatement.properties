display_name=Default entry handler
short_description=Defines a transaction default entry handler. | A <i>Handler</i> is similar to a <span class="computer">Function</span> except that it is automatically executed when the associated event occurs. The <i>Default entry handler</i> is a screen class entry handler, associated with an entry on a screen class event. If present in a transaction, it is executed when no specific screen class entry handler is defined for the currently detected screen class. In other words, it is a generic screen class entry handler.<br/>\
Thus, <i>Default entry handler</i> can be defined for multiple screen classes on which the programmer knows that the same actions are to be done.<br/>\
Beware that this handler will be executed for the <span class="computer">Default_screen_class</span> screen class if no specific handler is defined for this screen class. As the <span class="computer">Default_screen_class</span> screen class matches every page that is not defined in the connector, this handler can potentially be executed on a lot of unmanaged pages. Such behaviors can lead to infinite loop transactions.<br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Notes:</span> \
<ul><li>A <i>Default entry handler</i> contains other statements that define the actions to be performed. It can return a result value (<span class="computer">redetect</span> by default as this is an entry handler).</li>\
<li><i>Default entry handlers</i> can only be added to a transaction, one <i>Default entry handler</i> per transaction.</li></ul>
property.handlerResult.display_name=Result
property.handlerResult.short_description=Defines the handler's default resulting value. | Depending on the handler type, this property can be chosen among several available values.<br/>\
For a <i>Default entry handler</i>, this property can take the following values:\
<ul><li><span class="computer"><empty></span> or <span class="computer">""</span>: goes on and extracts data using extraction rules, </li>\
<li><span class="computer">continue</span>: similar to <span class="computer"><empty></span> value, </li>\
<li><span class="computer">redetect</span>: does not extract data and redetects a new screen class, </li>\
<li><span class="computer">skip</span>: stops the transaction without extracting data.</li></ul><br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Note:</span> The <i>Handler</i>'s default return value defined thanks to this property can be overridden by a child <i>Return</i> statement.
