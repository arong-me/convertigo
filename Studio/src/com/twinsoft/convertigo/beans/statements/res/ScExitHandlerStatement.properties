display_name=Screen class exit handler
short_description=Defines a screen class exit handler. | A {{Reference}}Handler{{-Reference}} is similar to a {{Computer}}Function{{-Computer}} except that it is automatically executed when the associated event occurs. The {{Reference}}Screen class exit handler{{-Reference}} is a handler associated with the exit from a screen class event. It is executed when Convertigo detects the screen class corresponding to this {{Reference}}Screen class exit handler{{-Reference}}, after having executed the extraction rules associated with this screen class.\n\
In other words, a {{Reference}}Screen class exit handler{{-Reference}} is executed when leaving the screen class associated with this handler.\n\
{{Orange Twinsoft}}Notes:{{-Orange Twinsoft}} \
***A {{Reference}}Screen class exit handler{{-Reference}} contains other statements that define the actions to be performed on this screen class. It can return a result value ({{Computer}}accumulate{{-Computer}} by default as it is an exit handler).\
***{{Reference}}Screen class exit handlers{{-Reference}} can only be added to a transaction, one {{Reference}}Screen class exit handler{{-Reference}} for each screen class per transaction.
property.handlerResult.display_name=Result
property.handlerResult.short_description=Defines the handler's default resulting value. | Depending on the handler type, this property can be chosen among several available values.\n\
For a {{Reference}}Screen class exit handler{{-Reference}}, this property can take the following values:\
***{{Computer}}<empty>{{-Computer}} or {{Computer}}""{{-Computer}}: stops the process and ends the transaction, \
***{{Computer}}continue{{-Computer}}: similar to {{Computer}}<empty>{{-Computer}} value, \
***{{Computer}}accumulate{{-Computer}}: accumulates extracted data (data is extracted from last detected screen class then added to any other extracted data) and redetects a new screen class.\n\
{{Orange Twinsoft}}Note:{{-Orange Twinsoft}} The {{Reference}}Handler{{-Reference}}'s default return value defined thanks to this property can be overridden by a child {{Reference}}Return{{-Reference}} statement.
