display_name=IfXpathExistsThenElse
short_description=Defines an <span class="computer">IF...THEN...ELSE...</span> conditional statement looking for node(s) on a web page. | The <i>IfXpathExistsThenElse</i> statement is one of the <i>HTML transaction</i> conditional statements. It contains two child steps (<i>Then</i> and <i>Else</i>) which are executed depending on the condition fulfillment: \
<ul><li><span class="computer">Then</span> step and child steps are executed when the condition is verified, </li>\
<li><span class="computer">Else</span> step and child steps are executed when the condition is not verified.</li></ul><br/>\
The condition is the existence in the current web page of nodes matching the XPath defined through the <b>XPath</b> property. <br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Note:</span> In Convertigo Studio, when an <i>IfXpathExistsThenElse</i> statement is created in a handler, it can be easily replaced by an <i>IfXpathExists</i>, using the right-click menu on the statement and choosing the option <b>Change to</b> > <b>IfXpathExists</b>. The <b>XPath</b> property remains the same and the statements present in the sub-statements are:\
<ul><li>statements present in the <i>Then</i> statement are moved to the <i>IfXpathExists</i>, </li>\
<li>statements present in the <i>Else</i> statement are deleted.</li></ul>
property.condition.display_name=XPath
property.condition.short_description=Defines the XPath expression to test. | This property is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the transaction execution as an XPath. <br/>\
The execution of this <b>XPath</b> on the web page DOM is used as a condition in order to decide whether to execute or not the child statements: \
<ul><li><span class="computer">true</span> if one or several nodes are matching the XPath, </li>\
<li><span class="computer">false</span> if no node matches.</li></ul>
