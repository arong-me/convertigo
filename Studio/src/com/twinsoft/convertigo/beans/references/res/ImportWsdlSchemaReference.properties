short_description=References a WSDL file and imports its schemas in this project. | The <i>Import WSDL schema</i> reference enhances the current project's schema by importing the referenced WSDL file's schemas. <br/>\
The imported XSD objects (types, elements, groups, ...) can be used anywhere in current project sequences, using the <b>Assigned XSD Complex type QName</b> and <b>Assigned XSD Element ref QName</b> properties. <br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Note:</span> The imported WSDL file should declare a target namespace different from the target namespace of the current project. It is mandatory for an XSD to be imported in another.
