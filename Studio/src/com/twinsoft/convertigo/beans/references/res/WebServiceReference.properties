display_name=Import web service
short_description=References a web service by creating the {{Reference}}HTTP connector{{-Reference}} with all transactions matching the web service methods, referencing its WSDL file and importing its schemas in this project. | The {{Reference}}Import web service{{-Reference}} reference creates an {{Reference}}HTTP connector{{-Reference}} configured to target the web service. It automatically creates {{Reference}}XML HTTP transactions{{-Reference}} for each method described by the web service, including their variables. \n\
The {{Reference}}Import web service{{-Reference}} reference also enhances the current project's schema by importing the referenced WSDL file's schemas (such as an {{Reference}}Import WSDL schema{{-Reference}} reference). \n\
The imported XSD objects (types, elements, groups, ...) are automatically used to define the transactions output schemas. They can also be used anywhere in current project sequences, using the {{Produit/Fonction}}Assigned XSD Complex type QName{{-Produit/Fonction}} and {{Produit/Fonction}}Assigned XSD Element ref QName{{-Produit/Fonction}} properties. \n\
{{Orange Twinsoft}}Notes:{{-Orange Twinsoft}} \
***The referenced WSDL file is copied locally in current project's resources, in {{Computer}}wsdl{{-Computer}} folder. \
***The imported WSDL file should declare a target namespace different from the target namespace of the current project. It is mandatory for an XSD to be imported in another.
