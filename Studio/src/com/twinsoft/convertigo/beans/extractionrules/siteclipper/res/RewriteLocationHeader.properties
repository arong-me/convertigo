short_description=Rewrites the "<span class="computer">Location</span>" header value of a Site Clipper response. | The <i>Rewrite location header</i> extraction rule rewrites the "<span class="computer">Location</span>" header value of a Site Clipper response. <br/>\
This response header is mostly used to redirect the recipient to a location other than the requested one for completion of the request or identification of a new resource. The extraction rule rewrites this URL in order to access the new location through Convertigo Site Clipper. <br/>\
The <i>Rewrite location header</i> extraction rule's behavior depends on the type of URL found in the header. If the URI specified by the location's value is absolute, two cases are possible:\
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022  if the URI doesn't match a black listed domain defined in <i>Site Clipper connector</i>, the header value is automatically rewritten, <br/>\
 \u2022  else, the header value remains unchanged. <br/>\
<br/>\
If the URI specified by the location's value is relative, it is automatically rewritten. <br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Note:</span> If applicable, location's URI is rewritten to an absolute value so that next client's request for the given resource is correctly handled by Convertigo.
