display_name=jException
short_description=Raises a Convertigo Engine exception. | In some circumstances, it is necessary to explicitly raise a Convertigo Engine exception. This is reflected as a {{Computer}}SoapFaultException{{-Computer}} for SOAP web service callers or by an error structure in XML output for any other caller. \n\
{{Produit/Fonction}}Message{{-Produit/Fonction}} and {{Produit/Fonction}}Details{{-Produit/Fonction}} properties can be set to complex JavaScript expressions, mixing text strings and data from variables. These expressions are evaluated during the sequence execution and build a dynamic message and details output in the raised exception. \n\
The error XML structure contains a {{Computer}}type{{-Computer}} attribute, which value is automatically set to {{Computer}}c8o{{-Computer}} in case of Exception. It allows to differentiate an irrecoverable Server error from a project/applicative error created using an {{Reference}}Error{{-Reference}} step ({{Computer}}type{{-Computer}} attribute value is then {{Computer}}project{{-Computer}}). \n\
A {{Reference}}jException{{-Reference}} step breaks the sequence execution flow, the sequence ends just after this step's execution (contrary to {{Reference}}Error{{-Reference}} step which does not break the execution flow).
property.message.display_name=Message
property.message.short_description=Provides the (humanly readable) error message. | This property allows the developer to dynamically define the message text of the raised Exception, depending on the sequence execution. 
property.details.display_name=Details
property.details.short_description=Provides additional details about the triggered error. | This property allows the developer to dynamically add some details content in the raised Exception, depending on the sequence execution.
