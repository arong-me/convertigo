short_description=Defines an <span class="computer">IF</span> conditional step based on a JavaScript condition. | The <i>jIf</i> step is one of Convertigo Sequencer conditional steps. This step is based on a JavaScript condition and contains other steps executed only if the condition is fulfilled.<br/>\
The condition, defined in the <b>Condition</b> property, is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the sequence execution as <span class="computer">true</span> or <span class="computer">false</span>. If the condition is considered <span class="computer">true</span>, then steps under the parent <i>jIf</i> step are executed. If the condition is considered <span class="computer">false</span>, the steps under the parent <i>jIf</i> step are not executed. <br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Note:</span> In Convertigo Studio, when an <i>jIf</i> step is created in a sequence, it can be easily replaced by an <i>jIfThenElse</i>, using the right-click menu on the step and choosing the option <b>Change to</b> &gt; <b>jIfThenElse</b>. The <b>Condition</b> property remains the same and the steps present in the <i>jIf</i> are moved to the <i>Then</i> sub-step.
