display_name=Write binary from Base64
short_description=Writes a binary file from a Base64 content. | The {{Reference}}Write binary from Base64{{-Reference}} step allows writing a {{Computer}}Base64{{-Computer}} content from a response XML in a binary file on the disk. \n\
It can either create a new file or update an existing file, if a file of the same path and name already exists. \n\
The file extension has to be defined: it corresponds to the type of binary file to write. It can be set in the {{Produit/Fonction}}Output file{{-Produit/Fonction}} property, at the end of the file path. \n\
A {{Computer}}Base64{{-Computer}} content must be used as input, defined by the {{Produit/Fonction}}Source{{-Produit/Fonction}} property. Such input content could be picked in output XML of transactions, for example: \
***in an {{Reference}}HTML transaction{{-Reference}} XML response: using the {{Reference}}Print screen{{-Reference}} extraction rule or the {{Reference}}Get attachment{{-Reference}} statement in the transaction would add {{Computer}}Base64{{-Computer}} content to output, \
***in an {{Reference}}SQL transaction{{-Reference}} XML response: if the database contains a column with {{Computer}}Base64{{-Computer}} data, this content would be present in transaction output, \
*** etc. \n\
