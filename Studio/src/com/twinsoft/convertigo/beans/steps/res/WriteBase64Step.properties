display_name=Write binary from Base64
short_description=Writes a binary file from a Base64 content. | The <i>Write binary from Base64</i> step allows writing a <span class="computer">Base64</span> content from a response XML in a binary file on the disk. <br/>\
It can either create a new file or update an existing file, if a file of the same path and name already exists. <br/>\
The file extension has to be defined: it corresponds to the type of binary file to write. It can be set in the <b>Output file</b> property, at the end of the file path. <br/>\
A <span class="computer">Base64</span> content must be used as input, defined by the <b>Source</b> property. Such input content could be picked in output XML of transactions, for example: \
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 in an <i>HTML transaction</i> XML response: using the <i>Print screen</i> extraction rule or the <i>Get attachment</i> statement in the transaction would add <span class="computer">Base64</span> content to output, <br/>\
 \u2022 in an <i>SQL transaction</i> XML response: if the database contains a column with <span class="computer">Base64</span> data, this content would be present in transaction output, <br/>\
 \u2022  etc. <br/>
