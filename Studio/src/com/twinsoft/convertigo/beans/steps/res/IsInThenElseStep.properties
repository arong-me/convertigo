display_name=IfIsInThenElse
short_description=Defines an <span class="computer">IF...THEN...ELSE...</span> conditional step looking for matches on a source. | The <i>IfIsInThenElse</i> step is one of the Convertigo Sequencer conditional steps. This step is based on a source and one or more regular expression(s) called "Tests". This step contains two child steps (<i>Then</i> and <i>Else</i>) which are executed depending on whether the specified source exists and if tests match on that specified source or not:\
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 <i>Then</i> step and child steps are executed when specified source exists and tests match on source, <br/>\
 \u2022 <i>Else</i> step and child steps are executed when specified source exists and tests do not match on source or when specified source does not exist. <br/>\
<br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Note:</span> In Convertigo Studio, when an <i>IfIsInThenElse</i> step is created in a sequence, it can be easily replaced by an <i>IfIsIn</i>, using the right-click menu on the step and choosing the option <b>Change to</b> &gt; <b>IfIsIn</b>. The <b>Source</b> and <b>Tests</b> properties remain the same and the steps present in the sub-steps are:\
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 steps present in the <i>Then</i> step are moved to the <i>IfIsIn</i>, <br/>\
 \u2022 steps present in the <i>Else</i> step are deleted.<br/>
