display_name=jIfThenElse
short_description=Defines an <span class="computer">IF...THEN...ELSE...</span> conditional step based on a JavaScript condition. | The <i>jIfThenElse</i> step is one of the Convertigo Sequencer conditional steps. This step is based on a JavaScript condition and contains two child steps (<i>Then</i> and <i>Else</i>) which are executed depending on the condition fulfillment:\
<ul><li><span class="computer">Then</span> step and child steps are executed when the condition is verified, </li>\
<li><span class="computer">Else</span> step and child steps are executed when the condition is not verified.</li></ul><br/>\
The condition, defined in the <b>Condition</b> property, is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the sequence execution as <span class="computer">true</span> or <span class="computer">false</span>. <br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Note:</span> In Convertigo Studio, when an <i>jIfThenElse</i> step is created in a sequence, it can be easily replaced by an <i>jIf</i>, using the right-click menu on the step and choosing the option <b>Change to</b> > <b>jIf</b>. The <b>Condition</b> property remains the same and the steps present in the sub-steps are:\
<ul><li>steps present in the <i>Then</i> step are moved to the <i>jIf</i>, </li>\
<li>steps present in the <i>Else</i> step are deleted.</li></ul>
