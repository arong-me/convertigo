display_name=jIterator
short_description=Defines a loop step iterating on list items result from a Javascript expression. | Also called {{Reference}}For Each{{-Reference}} step, the {{Reference}}jIterator{{-Reference}} step: \
***defines a Javascript expression as input list, i.e. the name of a multivalued variable, of a defined js array, of a previous {{Reference}}jSource{{-Reference}} defining a nodelist to work on, \
***iterates on each item of the specified input list, item which may be accessed through the Javascript {{Computer}}item{{-Computer}} variable\
***contains child steps that are executed on each iteration, as other loop steps (for example, see "{{Reference}}jWhile{{-Reference}}" and "{{Reference}}jDoWhile{{-Reference}}" steps documentation and examples).
property.condition.display_name=Max. iterations
property.condition.short_description=Defines the maximum number of iterations. | Intended mostly for testing purposes, this (optional) parameter limits the number of times the iterator loops. \n\
By default, it is not filled, so the {{Reference}}Iterator{{-Reference}} loops on each node from the source.
property.expression.display_name=Expression
property.expression.short_description=Defines the expression evaluated to give the list to iterate on. | This property is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the sequence execution and gives a list of items.
