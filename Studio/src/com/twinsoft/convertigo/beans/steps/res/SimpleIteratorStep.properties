display_name=jIterator
short_description=Defines a loop step iterating on list items result from a JavaScript expression. | Also called {{Reference}}For Each{{-Reference}} step, the {{Reference}}jIterator{{-Reference}} step: \
***defines a JavaScript expression as input list to work on, i.e. the name of a multi-valued variable, the name of a defined JavaScript Array, or the name of a NodeList variable created by a previous {{Reference}}jSource{{-Reference}} step, etc., \
***iterates on each item of the specified input list, \
***contains child steps that are executed on each iteration, as other loop steps (for example see "{{Reference}}Iterator{{-Reference}}", "{{Reference}}jWhile{{-Reference}}" and "{{Reference}}jDoWhile{{-Reference}}" steps documentation and examples).\n\
In the iteration, child steps can access and use: \
***the current iterated item through a JavaScript variable named {{Computer}}item{{-Computer}}, \
***the current iteration index through a JavaScript variable named {{Computer}}index{{-Computer}}.
property.condition.display_name=Max. iterations
property.condition.short_description=Defines the maximum number of iterations. | Intended mostly for testing purposes, this (optional) parameter limits the number of times the iterator loops. \n\
By default, it is not filled, so the {{Reference}}jIterator{{-Reference}} loops on each item from the list.
property.expression.display_name=Expression
property.expression.short_description=Defines the expression evaluated to give the list to iterate on. | This property is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the sequence execution and gives a list of items (JavaScript {{Computer}}Array{{-Computer}} or {{Computer}}NodeList{{-Computer}}).
property.startIndex.display_name=Starting index
property.startIndex.short_description=Defines the index from which the {{Reference}}jIterator{{-Reference}} should start to iterate. | In the case you do not want to start an iteration at the first item (index {{Computer}}1{{-Computer}}), you can specify a starting index in this property. \n\
This property is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the sequence execution. By default, it is set to {{Computer}}1{{-Computer}} for starting at the first item of the input list. \n\
If the defined starting index does not exist in the input list, the loop does not execute its child steps and the parent sequence execution continues.
