display_name=jIterator
short_description=Defines a loop step iterating on list items result from a JavaScript expression. | Also called <i>For Each</i> step, the <i>jIterator</i> step: \
<ul><li>defines a JavaScript expression as input list to work on, i.e. the name of a multi-valued variable, the name of a defined JavaScript Array, or the name of a NodeList variable created by a previous <i>jSource</i> step, etc., </li>\
<li>iterates on each item of the specified input list, </li>\
<li>contains child steps that are executed on each iteration, as other loop steps (for example see "<i>Iterator</i>", "<i>jWhile</i>" and "<i>jDoWhile</i>" steps documentation and examples).</li></ul><br/>\
In the iteration, child steps can access and use: \
<ul><li>the current iterated item through a JavaScript variable named <span class="computer">item</span>, which type depends on the iterated Array or NodeList, </li>\
<li>the current iteration index through a JavaScript variable named <span class="computer">index</span>, which is an integer.</li></ul>
property.condition.display_name=Max. iterations
property.condition.short_description=Defines the maximum number of iterations. | Intended mostly for testing purposes, this (optional) parameter limits the number of times the iterator loops. <br/>\
By default, it is not filled, so the <i>jIterator</i> loops on each item from the list.
property.expression.display_name=Expression
property.expression.short_description=Defines the expression evaluated to give the list to iterate on. | This property is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the sequence execution and gives a list of items (JavaScript <span class="computer">Array</span> or <span class="computer">NodeList</span>). <br/>\
If the expression doesn't output a list object or if the expression is left blank, the step has no data to work on: the loop does not execute its child steps and the parent sequence execution continues
property.startIndex.display_name=Starting index
property.startIndex.short_description=Defines the index from which the <i>jIterator</i> should start to iterate. | In the case you do not want to start an iteration at the first item (index <span class="computer">0</span>), you can specify a starting index in this property. <br/>\
This property is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the sequence execution. By default, it is set to <span class="computer">0</span> for starting at the first item of the input list. <br/>\
If the defined starting index does not exist in the input list, the loop does not execute its child steps and the parent sequence execution continues.
