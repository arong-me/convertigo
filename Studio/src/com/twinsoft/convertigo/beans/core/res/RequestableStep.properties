display_name=RequestableStep
short_description=Defines a requestable step.
property.contextName.display_name=Context
property.contextName.short_description=Defined the specific context name to use (one is automatically created otherwise). | The execution context of called transaction/sequence can be named:\
***after the {{Produit/Fonction}}Context{{-Produit/Fonction}} property of the {{Reference}}Call transaction{{-Reference}}/{{Reference}}Call sequence{{-Reference}} step,\
***automatically thanks to parent sequence parameters, if the {{Produit/Fonction}}Context{{-Produit/Fonction}} property is not specified.\n\
Every automatically named context will be deleted at the end of the sequence execution. Explicitly named contexts will remain for further transaction or sequence use. To re-use a named context, pass context name to the transaction/sequence through:\
***the {{Produit/Fonction}}Context{{-Produit/Fonction}} property of {{Reference}}Call transaction{{-Reference}}/{{Reference}}Call sequence{{-Reference}} step,\
***the {{Computer}}__context{{-Computer}} parameter sent to Convertigo while calling the transaction/sequence.
property.orderedVariables.display_name=Variables
property.orderedVariables.short_description=Ordered variables priorities. | When the call sequence (or transaction) step is executed, variables sent to the sequence (or transaction) are given a value in the following order:\
***Source value: If a source has been defined for the sequence (or transaction) variable, its value is sent.\***JavaScript scope value: If no source has been defined, or the retrieved source value is null, the variable is searched for in the sequence (or transaction) JavaScript scope.\n\
Note that sequence (or transaction) variables (received by the sequence/transaction or sequence/transaction default values) are inserted in the scope.\n\
***Context value : If no value has been found yet, the variable value is searched for in the sequence context.\
***Default call sequence/transaction step value : If the variable was not defined in the context, the variable is given the default value defined for the step.\
***If no value is found at all, the sequence/transaction is returned an empty variable. 
property.bInternalInvoke.display_name=Internal invoke
property.bInternalInvoke.short_description=Defines if the called transaction/sequence should be called internally to the Convertigo engine or externally (i.e. via the web application server).
