property.accessibility.display_name=Accessibility
property.accessibility.short_description=Defines the requestable accessibility. | If set to {{Computer}}public{{-Computer}}, the requestable is exposed in the SOAP WSDL as a web service method. If set to {{Computer}}private{{-Computer}}, the transaction/sequence cannot be requested as SOAP web service method (for tests, unfinished transactions/sequences or functionalities not to be exposed). 
property.encodingCharSet.display_name=Character set
property.encodingCharSet.short_description=Defines the character set used for operations on the generated XML document (default: {{Computer}}UTF-8{{-Computer}}).
property.responseExpiryDate.display_name=Response lifetime
property.responseExpiryDate.short_description=Defines the response time-to-live (in seconds) in cache context, time during which the cached response remains valid or time interval for its renewal. |  Specifies the Convertigo server cache settings. Set the property to the following values to enable the cache:\
*** {{Computer}}<empty>{{-Computer}}: No cache, the response will not be cached and each request will execute the complete transaction. \
*** {{Computer}}absolute,<time in secs>{{-Computer}}: The response will be cached for the time specified in seconds. If an other request with the same parameters occurs within this time, the response will be returned from the cache.  \
*** {{Computer}}daily,hh:mm:ss{{-Computer}}: The response will be cached until {{Computer}}hh:mm:ss{{-Computer}} of the current day is reached. If an other request with the same parameters occurs before this time, the response will be returned from the cache. {{Produit/Fonction}}A new day starts at 00:00:00.{{-Produit/Fonction}} \
*** {{Computer}}weekly,hh:mm:ss,w{{-Computer}}: The response will be cached until {{Computer}}hh:mm:ss{{-Computer}} of the {{Computer}}wth{{-Computer}} day of week is reached. For Sunday w = 1, for Monday w = 2 ... and for Saturday w = 7. If an other request with the same parameters occurs before this time, the response will be returned from the cache. {{Produit/Fonction}}A new day starts at 00:00:00.{{-Produit/Fonction}} \
*** {{Computer}}monthly,hh:mm:ss,d{{-Computer}}: The response will be cached until {{Computer}}hh:mm:ss{{-Computer}} of the {{Computer}}dth{{-Computer}} day of month is reached. If an other request with the same parameters occurs before this time, the response will be returned from the cache. {{Produit/Fonction}}A new day starts at 00:00:00.{{-Produit/Fonction}} 
property.responseTimeout.display_name=Response timeout
property.responseTimeout.short_description=Defines the response maximum waiting time (in seconds). | Maximum time (in seconds) for a transaction/sequence to run. When specified time is reached, the transaction/sequence ends and returns a timeout error. If requested through the SOAP interface, the error is returned as a SOAP exception.
property.sheetLocation.display_name=Style sheet
property.sheetLocation.short_description=Defines how the XML returned by the transaction has to be processed by XSLT. | This property can take three values:\
***{{Computer}}None{{-Computer}}: Do not process with XSLT. Usual setting for Web services (SOAP or REST) where plain XML data is to be returned.\
***{{Computer}}From transaction{{-Computer}}/{{Computer}}From sequence{{-Computer}}: Use the XSL style sheet attached to the transaction/sequence. When used, make sure a style sheet is added to the transaction/sequence.\
***{{Computer}}From last detected screen class{{-Computer}}/{{Computer}}From last detected step{{-Computer}}: Use XSL style sheet attached to the last detected screen class (in case of a transaction) or XSL style sheet attached to the last detected step (in case of sequence). \n\
Transactions using sheets from last detected screen class are mainly used in Web Clipping or Legacy Publishing projects.
property.billable.display_name=Call the biller
property.billable.short_description=Defines whether the billing management module should be called for each generated XML document. | If this property is set to {{Computer}}true{{-Computer}}, the applicable billing management module, defined thanks to the connector's billing class name property, is invoqued. {{Produit/Fonction}}This parameter should never be changed{{-Produit/Fonction}} (Convertigo private use only).
property.clientCachable.display_name=Response client cache
property.clientCachable.short_description=Defines whether the transaction/sequence response should be cached by the client. |  If set to {{Computer}}false{{-Computer}}, the response XML is sent to the client along with HTTP headers forcing the client browser not to store it in its local cache. This is the default value, since dynamic responses are usually preferred. If set to {{Computer}}true{{-Computer}}, the XML response is sent normally.
property.secureConnectionRequired.display_name=Secure connection required
property.secureConnectionRequired.short_description=Defines whether the requestable should be called thru a secured connection or not (e.g. HTTPS). | Depending on the requester, if this property is set to {{Computer}}true{{-Computer}}, the reuestable must be accessed thru a secure connection (e.g. HTTPS in case of HTTP access).
