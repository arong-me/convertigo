display_name=Translate text
short_description=Translates text in blocks according to a given dictionary. | This rule translates the blocks on which it is applied using a dictionary file that is defined in the {{Produit/Fonction}}Dictionary{{-Produit/Fonction}} property. \n\
The translation is applied block by block, meaning that the block text content is searched as key in the dictionary to find its translation. \n\
In order to manage several languages, the dictionary file name can be automatically extended with a "lang" suffix which value is retrieve from the Document element of the output XML. To add this attribute to the Document element of the output XML, you can use the following code in a transaction handler (for example in the {{Computer}}onTransactionStarted{{-Computer}} handler): \n\
{{Computer}}dom.getDocumentElement().setAttribute("lang", "en-us");{{-Computer}}
property.dictionary.display_name=Dictionary
property.dictionary.short_description=Defines the path of the file to read for the translation (must be in UTF8 format). | This path is either absolute or relative to the project's directory. Paths starting with:\
***{{Computer}}./{{-Computer}} are relative to Convertigo home,\
***{{Computer}}.//{{-Computer}} are relative to the project folder.
property.generateOrphans.display_name=Generate orphans list
property.generateOrphans.short_description=If true, unknown words are written in a {{Computer}}dictionary<lang>.orphans{{-Computer}} file. | Unknown words are block text contents that are not found in the dictionary. This property can be activated in development environment to help the developer finding the dictionary problems or project inconsistencies. \n\
This should be disabled in production environment to preserve resources.
