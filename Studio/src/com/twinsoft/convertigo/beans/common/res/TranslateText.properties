display_name=Translate text
short_description=Translates text in blocks according to a given dictionary. | This rule translates the blocks on which it is applied using a dictionary file that is defined by the {{Produit/Fonction}}Dictionary{{-Produit/Fonction}} property. \n\
The translation is applied block by block, meaning that the block text content is searched as key in the dictionary to find its translation. Blocks have to be split according to dictionary entries. \n\
In order to manage several languages, the dictionary file name can automatically be extended with a "lang" suffix which value is retrieve from the {{Computer}}lang{{-Computer}} attribute of the document element of the output XML. \n\
The {{Computer}}lang{{-Computer}} attribute of the document element is set by Convertigo using the {{Computer}}__lang{{-Computer}} reserved parameter value. \n\
You can also update this attribute by script in a transaction's core. To do so, you can use the following code in one of its handlers: {{Computer}}dom.getDocumentElement().setAttribute("lang", "en-us");{{-Computer}}
property.dictionary.display_name=Dictionary
property.dictionary.short_description=Defines the path of the file to read for the translation. | This path is either absolute or relative to the project's directory. Paths starting with:\
***{{Computer}}./{{-Computer}} are relative to Convertigo home,\
***{{Computer}}.//{{-Computer}} are relative to the project folder. \n\
The dictionary file name should be of the following form {{Computer}}dictionary<lang>.txt{{-Computer}}, the <lang> parameter being overwritten by the {{Computer}}lang{{-Computer}} attribute value of the document element of the output XML. \n\
The dictionary file should define all text matches between the original application language and the needed output language. \n\
This file should be written using the following format: \
***the original text on a first line, \
***the translated text on a second line, \
***an empty line as separator, \
***etc. \n\
Not found texts will appear as errors in the Convertigo engine logs and may be automatically listed in an orphans file, depending on the {{Produit/Fonction}}Generate orphans list{{-Produit/Fonction}} property value.
property.generateOrphans.display_name=Generate orphans list
property.generateOrphans.short_description=If true, unknown texts are written in a {{Computer}}dictionary<lang>.orphans{{-Computer}} file. | Unknown words are block text contents that are not found in the dictionary. This property can be activated in development environment to help the developer finding the dictionary problems or project inconsistencies. \n\
This should be disabled in production environment to preserve resources.
